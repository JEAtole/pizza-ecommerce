# PIZZA E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
Application Development

Our project is a sample pizza e-commerce website developed to streamline online ordering and management for pizza businesses.
It is built using XAMPP, leveraging its Apache server for hosting and MySQL for database management.
The website's front end is crafted with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface, while PHP and SQL power the back-end functionalities, ensuring efficient handling of orders, customer data, and inventory.
